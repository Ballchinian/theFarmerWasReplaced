# theFarmerWasReplaced
The following Python code was constructed through the steam game theFarmerWasReplaced. It isnt a 1-1 of the python language, however it is practiclly the same. 
It contains a sorting algothithm, a close-ended maze solver, and solutions to many problems posed by the game.
Ive not finished all the game has to offer but im excited to eventually completed problems such as a open-ended maze solver.
